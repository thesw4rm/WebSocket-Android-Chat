The initial idea of our application was to create an app that would allow users to chat over Wi-Fi using public-key encryption. This would ensure that users messages could not be intercepted over Wi-Fi and read. We also decided that we would be using Kotlin instead of Java. 

Because of the complicated nature of our application, testing became quite difficult. Even coming up with easy to test scenarios was difficult since most of the application had to be fully functional before we could even test most of the components. An example being is having to test connections between two users (since it is a messaging application). This would involve using multiple devices or multiple emulators.  

Targeted testing device: Pixel 2XL
